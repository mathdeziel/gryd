# gryd
A simple and lightweight CSS grid framework.

## gryd?
Yup. *Grid*, with a *Y*.  Trendy.  All the cool kids do it, look it up.

## Really, *really* lightweight
gryd only offers, as its name implies, a grid and some utility classes.  It's a good starting point for small projects, and can even be quite enough for simple landing pages.

I mainly made gryd so that I could understand how CSS grid frameworks work.  I do personally use it for some small projects, but it is by no mean perfect.

Having said that, feel free to use it or build upon it.  If you do, [drop me line](https://www.twitter.com/mathdeziel), it will make me smile :)
